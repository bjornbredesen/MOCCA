Description: Models cis-regulatory module sequences in terms of motif enrichment
 MOCCA models cis-regulatory module DNA sequences in terms of their motif composition,
 given training sequences and motifs. MOCCA contains a reimplementation of the
 PREdictor algorithm, an implementation of the SVM-MOCCA algorithm, as well as
 a variety of feature space formulations that can be combined with either
 un-weighted summation, log-odds weighting or Support Vector Machines.
