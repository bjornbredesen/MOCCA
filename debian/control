Description: Models cis-regulatory module sequences in terms of motifs
 MOCCA models cis-regulatory module DNA sequences in terms
 of their motif composition, given training sequences and motifs.
 MOCCA contains a reimplementation of the PREdictor algorithm, an
 implementation of the SVM-MOCCA algorithm, as well as a variety of
 feature space formulations that can be combined with either
 un-weighted summation, log-odds weighting or Support Vector Machines.
